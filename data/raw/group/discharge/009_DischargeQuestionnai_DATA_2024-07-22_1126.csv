And I also couldn't wear sunglasses while outside which made my eyes strain since they are quite sensitive to daylight. ";"While studying they would cause me some discomfort. ";"I would say I got the habit of readjusting them but other than that nothing. ";"Yes. Some strangers in public. A lot of my friends also asked about them too. ";"I would've personally liked it more if the glasses were like a diadem so that I wouldn't have to worry about them slipping all the time.";2
