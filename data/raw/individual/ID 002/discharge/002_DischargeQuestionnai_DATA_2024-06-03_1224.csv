","the glasses would get blurry often and it affected vision. for example I was watching a movie over the weekend, and I had to lift up the glasses for a few seconds to improve clarity of the visuals on screen. also during work, I'd lift them up for a few seconds just to improve focus. And since I don't wear any prescription glasses, to wear something on my eyes for a prolonged period was quite challenging due to lack of adaptation.","Commute in the uban. since mostly people are sitting Infront of eachother, they get paranoid about me recording them. so far nobody explicitly called me out, only 2 or 3 people asked out of curiosity, but I realized that people must be thinking that way.","I tried limiting my daily commute.i for example went to the gym only once last week because I was concerned about people assuming that I'm violating privacy at the gym. or I shifted to working mostly from home. or ask my boyfriend to accompany me for groceries so that I feel comfortable.  Also like I said earlier the glasses would get blurry so I'd lift it often.   ","if I recall correctly, 2-3 people asked me out of curiosity what I was wearing. there first question always was ""is this a camera?"". they'd sound concerned at first but when I'd tell them it's for light exposure recording, they'd ask more questions out of curiosity and appreciate the effort. ","I think the sensor around neck is feasible design wise.   if you want to resume doing it on eye level, then maybe attach the light logger to a headband with velcro or a cap. this adjustment could atleast remove the discomfort of wearing glasses.
